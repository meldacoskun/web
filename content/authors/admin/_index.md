Welcome üëã I'm glad that you're here <i class="fas fa-heart" style="color:#0074D9"></i>.

I am a PhD data scientist, cognitive scientist, and user experience researcher. In my current role as the quantitative UX researcher at McMaster University in collaboration with CBC/Radio-Canada, I lead and conduct research to improve closed caption presentation in children's programming using eye-tracking and remote testing methods.

I have over 8 years of experience across industry and academia, and I'm passionate about transforming diverse data types---like *language data, neurosignals, eye movements, and any other forms of data* ---into actionable insights I achieve this through meticulous analysis using <i class="fab fa-r-project" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#035AA6"></i>, clear visualization, and compelling presentations. My goal is to facilitate data-driven decisions that drive meaningful outcomes.

I'm also a professional flamenco dancer üíÉ and a dedicated yogini üßò.
