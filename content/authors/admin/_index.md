title: Melda Coskun
bio: My research interests revolve around two key areas: data science and quantitative user experience research (UXR). In data science, I am fascinated by the exploration and analysis of large datasets to extract meaningful insights and patterns. This involves employing statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization methods to uncover valuable information.

On the other hand, my interest in quantitative UXR lies in understanding user behaviors, preferences, and interactions with digital products or services. I enjoy leveraging quantitative research methods such as surveys, experiments, and analytics data to gain deep insights into user experiences and inform design decisions.

By combining these two areas, I aim to contribute to the development of data-driven solutions that enhance user satisfaction, usability, and overall product effectiveness.

With over 8 years of experience spanning industry and academia, my passion lies in uncovering patterns across diverse data sets. I specialize in analyzing complex data types including language data, neurosignals, eye movements, and human behavior data. I'm skilled at transforming data into actionable insights through thorough analysis, clear visualization, and compelling presentations. I have experience tailoring these to stakeholders with diverse backgrounds, helping improve data-driven decision-making using <i class="fab fa-r-project" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#035AA6"></i>.

When I'm not coding or analyzing data in front of the computer, I'm always on the move. I'm a professional flamenco dancer and a dedicated yogini.
