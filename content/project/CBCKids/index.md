# Overview

The journey of becoming skilled readers can be one of the toughest challenges for children. However, something they thoroughly enjoy, without any struggle, is spending countless hours engaging online. Closed captions in these videos can be a game-changer in this learning adventure. By making captions more effective, we can transform screen time into a more enriching reading experience for kids. This can significantly immprove their reading skills, word recognition, comprehension, and overall enjoyment of content, as research suggests. These captions are especially crucial for children with hearing impairments, limited reading abilities, or those who speak a different language from the content.

With a diverse range of content, CBC Kids has attracted a massive following of Canadian children and youth, with an average of two million monthly visits across their digital platforms[^1].

## Research Goals

In this project, in collaboration with **CBC Kids**, **CanChild** and **the Reading Lab** research centers of McMaster, our goal is to improve the viewing and reading experiences of the young viewers by making captions more readable and effective.

After considering several factors, including closed captioning rate, editing, line breaks, typography, we decided to investigate the factors of attention enhancing manipulation (as shown in **the karaoke-style** in the Figure \@ref(fig:above)) and positioning (as shown in **the dynamic positioning** in the Figure \@ref(fig:above)) on the efficiency of closed captions, with **the traditional bottom** presentation (as shown in the bottom positioning in the Figure \@ref(fig:above) again).

## Business Value

**How does this research contribute to CBC's business objectives?** CBC Kids isn't just about creating content; they're also dedicated to supporting educational journeys through initiatives like *CBC Kids News, Street Cents,* and *CBC Kids at School.* Improving closed captions in children's programming will empower millions of young minds at home and school. This research effort will support CBC Kids' reputation as a trusted source for both entertainment and educational content, showing their commitment to providing enriching experiences for children across Canada.

## Metholodology

In this research, I combined attitudinal research with behavioral research techniques together.

-   I used eye-tracking techniques and surveys to collect quantitative data. This helped determine the most effective closed caption style for children's content comprehension. Eye-tracking provided valuable insights into where and when viewers paid attention.

-   Attitudinal data provided insights into children's preferences regarding their preferred closed caption style.

-   We tested 67 children both remotely and in person.

## Achieved Miles Stones:

As a Primary Quantitative User Experience Researcher (UXR), I managed entire project lifecycle:

-   Successfully submitted and obtained approval for the REB application.
-   Conducted competitive and secondary research, analyzing scientific literature and industry trends to identify key areas for enhancing closed caption presentations.
-   Implemented eye tracking and online surveys, as well as test materials, to gather comprehensive data.
-   Led a team of 2 Research Assistants, providing training and overseeing the recruitment of 67 children for in-person and online testing.
-   Developed efficient R code for analyzing survey responses and eye movement data, resulting in actionable insights.
-   Transformed raw data from eye-tracking tests and online user surveys into visually insightful representations using ggplot2 and Tableau, facilitating the identification of hidden patterns and insights.
-   Delivered over 20 reports and presentations that distilled complex topics like literature findings and research results into easily understandable and concise formats for senior leadership. This ensured their efficient understanding of key insights and kept them up to date with the latest information.
